Typically you will use {LINK:KitPage;kits} to initiate construction and then a variety of {LINK:ToolPage;tools} and {LINK:ResourcePage;resources} to complete. Pay close attention to how many of your kit are required to construct what you have selected, as some structures require more than one of the stack to be consumed. For some kits you will have multiple options, use the {COLORRED:Scroll Wheel} to change the current option you are looking to build.

{HEADER:Build States}
Some structures will have multiple build states that require different combinations to complete. Your tooltip will advise you of what combination you need to complete the structure. Sometimes you will need to have two objects, one in each hand, to complete a build state. Some tools will need to be turned on first, which can done by pressing {KEY:ToggleHandPower} while it's in your active hand.

{HEADER:Tooltips}
If you look directly at a structure that is incomplete you will get information about what you need to do to complete it. If you have a {LINK:ToolPage;tool} in your hand and its not the right {LINK:ToolPage;tool}, a tooltip will appear telling you what you would need to use to deconstruct it.

          <Text>{HEADER:Modular Rocket Cargo}

The {THING:StructureModularRocketCargo01} has capacity for two ten-slot crates. You can have multiple cargo modules on your rocket. The rocket can lift up to seven modules in total.

{HEADER:Modular Rocket Command}

The {THING:StructureModularRocketCommand01} must be placed on top of the rocket. It will assess the rocket’s readiness for flight. Once all conditions are met, the rocket can be launched when all players are seated in the module by pressing ‘IGNITION’ on the console.

The following conditions must be met for launch:

Fuel full
Fuel mix ratio correct
All players seated
Power supplied to the launch pad
Fully built rocket

The {THING:StructureModularRocketCommand01} console displays the current state of these conditions. It does not require an atmosphere for lift off - your suit’s atmosphere is sufficient.

{HEADER:Modular Rocket Engine}

The {THING:StructureModularRocketEngine01} is capable of lifting up to seven modules (including itself).

{HEADER:Modular Rocket Fuel Tank}

The {THING:StructureModularRocketFueltank01} requires a 2:1 mixture of {GAS:Volatiles} and {GAS:Oxygen}. If the mixture exceeds these proportions, or you place other gases in the tank, the {THING:StructureModularRocketCommand01} console will display an ‘Invalid’ error.

      <Text>The Solar System's planets are not as calm as they may seem. After seven days on any world with an atmosphere, the inscrutable forces of nature swing into action – hitting unwary Stationeers with blizzards, dust storms and volcanic events.
As such, the ODA recommends that freshly deployed Stationeers create an airtight base within 7 days of landing.
Any dynamic objects left outside in a storm – on Mars, Loulan, Vulcan or Europa – risks being blown far, far away, including your lander.
Likewise, be aware that solar panels are fragile and may have their glass shattered, or occasionally even be destroyed by a sufficiently ferocious storm. During storms, their output is also drastically reduced.

      <DisplayFilter>Guides</DisplayFilter>
      <Text>Stationeers get hungry eventually, but not all food is created equal. Also, your hunger rate varies depending on settings and difficulty. Eating will only consume that part of an item adequate to restoring your hunger to 100%.

All Stationeers receive a supply of &lt;color=#0080FFFF&gt;{LINK:Agrizero;Agrizero}&lt;/color&gt; {THING:ItemCerealBar} in their lander supplies at the outset of a new world. When these are exhausted, you must find new sources of sustenance.

Eating raw ingredients will satisfy hunger less than meals, ie will replace a smaller proportion of your hunger. The basic elements of food are created using &lt;color=#0080FFFF&gt;{LINK:OrganicsPage;hydroponics}&lt;/color&gt; systems. These can be processed into recipe ingredients using the {THING:ApplianceReagentProcessor), then turned into meals using a {THING:ApplianceMicrowave}.

Your hunger rate can be adjusted set in the main settings menu by adjusting the Hunger/Hydration rate slider.

      <Text>Your average Stationeer needs to drink water regularly. However, arcane and possibly misguided &lt;color=#0080FFFF&gt;{LINK:ODA;ODA}&lt;/color&gt; health and safety regulations have long denied Stationeers the right to in-suit hydration mechanisms. Instead, they must take regular drink breaks to open their helmet, and imbibe water. Doing so in an unpressurized environment is unadvised.

How often to drink? This is determined by your difficulty level, the heat of the planet and how much you like to move your body.

Water comes in many forms. At least one {THING:ItemWaterBottle} is supplied to Stationeers as part of their rations when landing on new planets, with more in your lander crates. These can be refilled using a {THING:ItemWaterBottleFiller}, which must itself be connected to a liquid pipe network. The network itself can be filled using a {THING:StructureIceCrusher} with a suitable supply of ice.

Your thirst rate can be adjusted set on the main settings menu by adjusting your Hunger/Hydration rate slider.

      <DisplayFilter>Guides</DisplayFilter>
      <Text>Your spacesuit provides you with a portable atmosphere, with adjustable pressure and air conditioning (temperature) settings, as well as an warning system that will alert you should the atmosphere inside the suit become hazardous. It functions in conjunction with a suitable helmet to function properly, as well as suitable gas canisters and filters in the suit's various slots. These will need to be changed regularly, and can also be recharged (or drained) using a {THING:StructureSuitStorage}.

There are several suits, including the {THING:ItemEvaSuit} and the more pressure- and temperature-resistant {THING:ItemHardSuit}.

Your suit various readouts are at the bottom-right of the screen. Pressing the appropriate numeric key (2will bring up a panel showing its slots and settings. These include:

- A/C On / Off (i.e. Temperature control on/off)
- Filters On / Off
- Air On / Off
- Pressure Up / Down (with a range of 0kPA to 202kPa, or 0-2 Earth atmospheres)
- Temperature Up / Down (with a range of 0°C to 60°C)

Suits contains 6-8 slots:
- Air tank (x1) - insert a canister or smart canister containing a breathable gas mix, eg O2 or nitrogen/oxygen 35/65.
- Waste tank (x1) - collects gases removed by the filters
- Life support (x1) - holds one battery, which powers your A/C, lights, etc.
- Filters (x3) - requires at least one CO2 filter (if human), depending on your breathable gas mix. Note that a {THING:ItemHardSuit} has 4 filter slots.
- IC - {THING:ItemHardSuit} only.

Pressure: should be set to 50-100 KPa (0.5 to 1 Earth atmospheres). Humans in-game tolerate up to ~250kPa and can survive up to ~300kPA.

Temperature: normally set to 18-21°C, with humans in-game preferring 10-29°C, tolerating 0-39°C and surviving around up to 49°C. In higher temperatures, your A/C will consume more battery power to maintain internal temperature.

Filters: the default filter is the CO2 filter, which captures the gas generated by humans when breathing out. If you are not using 100% oxygen in your breathing gas, add additional filters, eg if you mix 25% Oxygen + 75% nitrogen, the nitrogen will accumulate in your suit over time and suffocate you, unless you have a nitrogen filter. If you have the correct filters and breathable gas, but are still experiencing problems, use the 'Flush' function on your Space Helmet. Low/critical oxygen warnings will sound as your filters cease to function.

If damaged, your suit can be patched by holding duct tape in your hand and using 'activate' button.
