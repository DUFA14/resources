			<Value>Borznac the 5th isn't known for his niceties. After being cut out of several trade deals with Sinotai, he's decided to build an empire of his own, by taking control of all nearby Lunar bases, including yours.
You've been forced to work as his new personal chef. You still don't know what happened to his last chef, and you don't want to find out. He has quite the appetite, and is very impatient. So you better get cooking.</Value>
