      <Value>FOR TESTING: With only a meager amount of supplies, you must utilize your wits and spirit to find a way to survive on Mars.  All going to plan, this will ultimately lead to building a rocket that&apos;s capable of leaving Mars&apos; atmosphere.</Value>

Regardless of your environment your first priority is to check the health of yourself and those around you.  Be sure to check suit integrity as well as there is no telling what environment you may find yourself in and protecting whatever air supply you have is crucial.</Value>

      <Value>PAGE 1 of 5 \nBEG, BURROW or STEAL\n\nLuckily our manufacturing tools have knowledge of all the recipes you&apos;re likely to need in your situation.  Unfortunately, they&apos;ll need raw materials in order to do so.  These could come from several sources based on your situation:</Value>

A Recycler can be used to break these down into a mix of it&apos;s component materials and a Centrifuge will separate them out so they can be re-smelted into usable materials.</Value>

      <Value>PAGE 5 of 5\nSMELT\n\nThe most straightforward way to convert raw materials into processed ingots ready for manufacturing is using the Arc Furnace and providing it with some power.  If you&apos;re limited on resources it should probably be your first investment, as if you cannot scavenge sufficient materials it&apos;ll be a requirement eventually to ensure you&apos;re able to produce more.</Value>

It would be pertinent to plan for a longer stay.  You&apos;ll need to set up some basic manufacturing infrastructure.  An Autolathe is the natural starting point, and this will allow you to construct more task-specific crafting machines.</Value>

      <Value>PAGE 2 of 5 \nPOWER TO THE PERSON \n\nHopefully by this point you&apos;ve found some batteries, and some means to charge them.  The easiest way to supply power to a network is by connecting batteries to an Area Power Control unit.  To provide the power you&apos;ll need for Smelting and bulk manufacturing however, you&apos;ll need something a little more convenient.  The best way to handle this depends on your situation, but options include;</Value>

You can use your wrench to adjust the vertical and horizontal angle to try face the sun but in the long term you might want to look at using a logic circuit and a daylight sensor to track it for you.</Value>
